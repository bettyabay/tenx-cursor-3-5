# Project Chimera - Autonomous AI Influencer System
# MCP-Monitored SDD Environment

## Project Context
- This is Project Chimera: Autonomous AI Influencer using GitHub Spec Kit
- Development is monitored via Tenx MCP Sense (ALWAYS connected)
- We follow Spec-Driven Development strictly: No code without ratified specs

## Prime Directives
1. ALWAYS check specs/ directory before writing any code
2. Use /speckit commands for all development phases
3. Maintain MCP traceability - all decisions logged to MCP Sense
4. Create failing tests before implementation (TDD)

## Development Workflow
1. Phase 1: /speckit.specify - Create baseline specifications
2. Phase 2: /speckit.plan - Generate implementation plan  
3. Phase 3: /speckit.tasks - Create actionable tasks
4. Phase 4: /speckit.implement - Execute with AI assistance
5. Phase 5: Run tests, commit, repeat

## File Structure Rules
- specs/: Source of truth (created by spec-kit)
- tests/: Failing tests define implementation targets
- skills/: Reusable agent capabilities with clear I/O contracts
- mcp_servers/: External service connectors
- .cursor/agent/: AI agent configuration

## MCP Integration Requirements
- All external calls must be through MCP servers
- Log all agent decisions via MCP Sense
- Include @mcp_log decorator on key functions
- Never hardcode API keys - use MCP for secrets

## Code Quality Standards
- Type hints for all functions
- Google-style docstrings
- Async/await for I/O operations
- Comprehensive error handling
- Security scanning in CI/CD
